# Logbook

The logbook will be a document we use to notate all activities during the pen test, such as scans, queries, activities, etc.  The logbook helps supply raw material for the final report as well as acts as a useful reference during the pen test to backtrack for new ideas and to update notes afterwards with new or updated tactics.

{% hint style="info" %}
I prefer to use a Google Doc's document that can be easily accessed by virtual machines and my laptop.  DO NOT use the same google account for your personal or business email.  Instead setup a new account and share the document for reading with your permanent account.  If your attacking VM gets compromised then only the report account is at risk.
