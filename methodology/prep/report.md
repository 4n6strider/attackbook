# Report

The key deliverable of a penetration test is a report, which should have a minimum of the following sections:

* executive summary
* technical summary,
* vulnerabilities organized by risk
* remediation recommendations
* appendix for evidence

I prefer to use Google Docs for my report writing which can export to PDF for sending to a client.
