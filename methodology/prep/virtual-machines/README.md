# Virtual Machines

## Kali Linux

Kali is a Linux distribution tailored for penetration testing and comes with loads of curated tools already installed.  I recommend always being ready to lose or delete a VM and be able to quickly rebuild it from scratch.  

For that reason I recommend using the virtual machine appliances from Offensive Security. You will find both VMWare and Virtualbox appliances that can be quickly imported and customized.

 I always have the latest versions stored locally and ready to import.

If you prefer, you can always download the ISO images from the Kali website and install from scratch.
