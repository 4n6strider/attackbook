# Repository

Configure a private git repository that you will use to sync data such as nmap scan output files, data captures, screenshots, keys, logs, custom exploit code, etc from your virtual machine. In a worst case scenario if your VM crashes you can easily rebuild and download the repo to pick up where you left off. This data will also serve as raw material for your final report.

{% hint style="info" %}
Github, Gitlab and Bitbucket are excellent services for private git repositories with free entry-level tiers.
