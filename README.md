# Overview

### Prep

Organizing resources such as notes, data, templates, schedules, communication channels, virtual machines, tools, accounts and customized tactics.

### Recon

Passive information gathering about the target from openly available resources.

### Enumerate

Active information gathering by flyover network scanning and then more detailed endpoint scanning, probing and exploration.

### Exploit

Using the results of recon and enumeration, attempt exploits against targets to obtain footholds.

### Post Exploit

Once successfully exploiting targets, seek to elevate access to hosts, networks, users and data via privilege escalation and persistence.

Remove exploits, persistence, tools and any other artifacts. 

### Report

Summary, risks, impacts and remediation report.
