### Recon

### Enumerate

### Exploit

Using the results of recon and enumeration, attempt exploits against targets to obtain footholds.

### Elevate

Once successfully exploiting targets, seek to elevate access to hosts, networks, users and data.

### Persist

Establish persistent, discrete and reusable methods for access and data ex filtration.

### Cleanup
